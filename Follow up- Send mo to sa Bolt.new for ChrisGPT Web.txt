✅ Final Reminder
Review these instructions 10 times to ensure full accuracy and flawless implementation across all AI Assistants, screens, and user flows. Every instruction applies to all current and future AI Assistants.

Once done, review all my instructions again if you missed anything, fix it right away. Review and run again for the 3rd time and fix all issues. Review my instructions again, run and fix if you encounter any issues. You will not generate any output unless all my instructions are satisfied. Read my instructions 10 times, run the app ten times and fix it 20 times. No need to ask for my permission, just do it and make it perfect
